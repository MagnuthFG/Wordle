// TO DO LIST
===============================================================

# Fix so the grid points are added in the correct order
  Maybe it has something to do with the scaler so it inverts
  the point


# Create my own font SDF atlas in Substance Designer
  Create a scriptable object that finds the rect of each letter
  or sentence from the alpha channel of the font atlas?
  and stores that in a dictionary<string, rect>


# Make sure that the screen resolution check works
  Screen.currentResolution might not work in game window?
  Might have to use Screen.Width and Screen.Height instead?


# Read the txt file of words and put each word in a list?


# Use DateTime.Current.Date as the seed for the word of the day
  Then use System.Random(seed) to pick the word in the list
 
 
# Create a word comparing method
  First loop over chars in randomly selected word string
  Then loop over chars in player written string
  
  Check if the char in written string is same the as the
  the char in the word string. Then check if they loops
  have the same index. If they have, colour slot green,
  else colour it yellow and if nothing is right then red
  
  
# Fix so the submitted words are saved to a encrypted json file
  and is only reset on a new date. Store the date and words in
  a struct which is then converted to json

// BUGS AND IMPROVEMENTS
===============================================================

# Continue fixing the UIGrid
- Add a button underneath the grid that allow me to spawn
  the grid tiles in edit mode
  
  Also add a delete button that goes through and compares child
  objects to the prefab? If they are the same then remove it
  Must also delete the old ones when updating the grid
  
- Remove spawn on start and only have it in edit mode
  But keep the BuildGrid method public so it can be called
  from script
    
  
# Fix so the shaders/materials have higher render queue?
  Check if there is a UI render queue already that I can use?
  Else have UIObject manually set the render queue on Awake?
