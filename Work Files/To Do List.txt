// TO DO LIST
===============================================================
# Create a UIObject class and place on the slots
- Should contain a method for rescaling based on resolution?

- Should contain a method for changing material colour


# Create the UIGrid and UIObject
- Be able to specify number of slot rows and columns
  Set origin/centre screen position in percent
  Set offset for even and uneven rows and columns

- Specify default screen resolution and slot scale/size
  Rescale default slot scale/size based on current screen
  resolution. Have a script that checks every frame?

- Have scale and position dynamically update on screen
  resolution change


# Create a UIKeyboardKey class
  Include a public string getter for the letter
 

# Create a UIKeyboard class that fetches all UIKeyboardKey scripts in children
  and place these in a dictionary based on its letter


# In UIKeyboard get the anykey event and then get the key from that
  Use the key to trigger the KeyboardKey


# Read the txt file of words and put each word in a list?


# Use DateTime.Current.Date as the seed for the word of the day
  Then use System.Random(seed) to pick the word in the list
 
 
# Create a word comparing method
  First loop over chars in randomly selected word string
  Then loop over chars in player written string
  
  Check if the char in written string is same the as the
  the char in the word string. Then check if they loops
  have the same index. If they have, colour slot green,
  else colour it yellow and if nothing is right then red

// BUGS AND IMPROVEMENTS
===============================================================

# Add glow effects etc to the shaders so it looks more scifi!
  Add a white scifi panel background or something?


# Find out why the input font works with one font but not
  with the other ones. See if I can solve how to fix it!
  
  Maybe the other ones aren't square? 
  I might have to rescale the rect values if the width
  height ratio is not the same, aka 1,1?
  
  The lookup index is not correct on the official TMP fonts
  but works with the ones I've made. Test with more fonts
  and see what the problem is!
