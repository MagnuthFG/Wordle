// TO DO LIST
===============================================================
# Continue improving the UIElement
- Fix so that SetTransform notifies child transforms

- Fix so that it only notifies children on rescale
  if sizing is set to relative?

- Add enum Positioning fixed relative and add it to
  transform, underneath position. Will have to create
  a Reposition method and use that rather then Rescale


# Continue adding features to WordHandler
- Create the winning and loosing condition!
  Output the word of the day if you loose
  Debug.LogWarning($"Word of the Day: {_wordToday}");
  
- Fix so the submitted words are saved to a encrypted json file?
  and is only reset on a new date. Store the date and words in
  a struct which is then converted to json


===============================================================
// BUGS AND IMPROVEMENTS
===============================================================
# Continue adding features to FontSetup
- Improve the look of the inspector so the properties
  are next to the image. Maybe have them on a single line?
  Have the char be narrow so it only fits one character?


# Continue improving the UIElement
- Fix so that when changing the size and position in the
  inspector, it will adapt to parent scales and update its
  children as well, based on sizing


# Add the background 
- Create it via the shader and use UV coordinates for the
  "SDF" gradient and then the same masking approach as the
  other shaders

- Generate a square pattern or something so its more detailed?
  Use Fraq with world position and feed into the Box SDF or
  something? Boxes outside the boarder and hexagons inside?
  Add a separate colour for each shape outline?
  
  
# Continue fixing the UIGrid
- Add a button underneath the grid that allow me to spawn
  the grid tiles in edit mode
  
  Also add a delete button that goes through and compares child
  objects to the prefab? If they are the same then remove it
  Must also delete the old ones when updating the grid
  
- Remove spawn on start and only have it in edit mode
  But keep the BuildGrid method public so it can be called
  from script
    
  
# Continue improving the materials
- Fix so that I can set colour and character without creating
  material instances. Current setup adds too many draw calls!
  https://docs.unity3d.com/560/Documentation/Manual/GPUInstancing.html
 
- Fix so the shaders/materials have higher render queue?
  Check if there is a UI render queue already that I can use?
  Else have UIObject manually set the render queue on Awake?

# Continue improving the WordHandler
- Add glow/shake animations to the slots when a character
  is added to it? Maybe when it changes compare colour too?
