// TO DO LIST
===============================================================

# Continue fixing the UIElement
- Cash the transform to increase performance a little bit


# Continue fixing the UIGrid
- Add a button underneath the grid that allow me to spawn
  the grid tiles in edit mode
  
  Also add a delete button that goes through and compares child
  objects to the prefab? If they are the same then remove it
  Must also delete the old ones when updating the grid
  
- Remove spawn on start and only have it in edit mode
  But keep the BuildGrid method public so it can be called
  from script


# Continue on the UICanvas script
- Specify default screen resolution and slot scale/size
  Rescale default slot scale/size based on current screen
  resolution
  
- Check every frame for screen resolution change
  and if it does tell all child objects what scale multiplier
  they should have?


# Create a UIKeyboardKey class
  Include a public string getter for the letter
 

# Create a UIKeyboard class that fetches all UIKeyboardKey scripts in children
  and place these in a dictionary based on its letter


# In UIKeyboard get the anykey event and then get the key from that
  Use the key to trigger the KeyboardKey


# Read the txt file of words and put each word in a list?


# Use DateTime.Current.Date as the seed for the word of the day
  Then use System.Random(seed) to pick the word in the list
 
 
# Create a word comparing method
  First loop over chars in randomly selected word string
  Then loop over chars in player written string
  
  Check if the char in written string is same the as the
  the char in the word string. Then check if they loops
  have the same index. If they have, colour slot green,
  else colour it yellow and if nothing is right then red
  
  
# Fix so the submitted words are saved to a encrypted json file
  and is only reset on a new date. Store the date and words in
  a struct which is then converted to json

// BUGS AND IMPROVEMENTS
===============================================================

# Add glow effects etc to the shaders so it looks more scifi!
  Add a white scifi panel background or something?
  Use the SDF and smooth step to create inner and outer glow
  

# Find out why the input font works with one font but not
  with the other ones. See if I can solve how to fix it!
  
  Try removing padding from the rect and see if that
  creates a more favourable outcome on other fonts
  
  The lookup index is not correct on the official TMP fonts
  but works with the ones I've made. Test with more fonts
  and see what the problem is!
  
  
# Fix so the shaders/materials have higher render queue?
  Check if there is a UI render queue already that I can use?
  Else have UIObject manually set the render queue on Awake?
