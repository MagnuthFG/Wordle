// TO DO LIST
===============================================================
# Continue improving the UIElement
- Fix so that SetTransform notifies child transforms

- Fix so that it only notifies children on rescale
  if sizing is set to relative?

- Add enum Positioning fixed relative and add it to
  transform, underneath position. Will have to create
  a Reposition method and use that rather then Rescale


# Continue adding features to WordHandler
- Read the text file of words and put each word in a list

- Use DateTime.Current.Date as the seed for the word of the day
  Then use System.Random(seed) to pick the word in the list
 
- Create a word comparing method
  First loop over chars in randomly selected word string
  Then loop over chars in player written string
  
  Check if the char in written string is same the as the
  the char in the word string. Then check if they loops
  have the same index
  
- Colour the keyboard keys and and slots based on the guess
  If they char has the same index, colour the slot and key
  backgrounds green, else colour it yellow and if nothing is
  right then red or dark grey
  
- Fix so the submitted words are saved to a encrypted json file?
  and is only reset on a new date. Store the date and words in
  a struct which is then converted to json


===============================================================
// BUGS AND IMPROVEMENTS
===============================================================
# Continue adding features to FontSetup
- Improve the look of the inspector so the properties
  are next to the image. Maybe have them on a single line?
  Have the char be narrow so it only fits one character?


# Continue improving the UIElement
- Fix so that when changing the size and position in the
  inspector, it will adapt to parent scales and update its
  children as well, based on sizing


# Add the background 
- Create it via the shader and use UV coordinates for the
  "SDF" gradient and then the same masking approach as the
  other shaders

- Generate a square pattern or something so its more detailed?
  Use Fraq with world position and feed into the Box SDF or
  something? Boxes outside the boarder and hexagons inside?
  Add a separate colour for each shape outline?
  
  
# Continue fixing the UIGrid
- Add a button underneath the grid that allow me to spawn
  the grid tiles in edit mode
  
  Also add a delete button that goes through and compares child
  objects to the prefab? If they are the same then remove it
  Must also delete the old ones when updating the grid
  
- Remove spawn on start and only have it in edit mode
  But keep the BuildGrid method public so it can be called
  from script
    
  
# Continue improving the materials
- Fix so that I can set colour and character without creating
  material instances. Current setup adds too many draw calls!
  https://docs.unity3d.com/560/Documentation/Manual/GPUInstancing.html
 
- Fix so the shaders/materials have higher render queue?
  Check if there is a UI render queue already that I can use?
  Else have UIObject manually set the render queue on Awake?

# Continue improving the WordHandler
- Add glow/shake animations to the slots when a character
  is added to it? Maybe when it changes compare colour too?
